                    epitome of the skill of arts, crafts and architecture.
                    <br><br>
                    The four cave temples of Badami were built between the 6th and 7th centuries. The first temple
                    worships Lord Nataraja, while the second and third cave temples to Lord Vishnu and the fourth
                    temple to Lord Mahavira, the founder of Jainism. Though the exteriors are simple, they have
                    fascinating ornate interiors.
                    <br><br>
                    There are more than 81 sculptures of Lord Nataraja, ‘the cosmic dancer’, amorous couples,
                    deities of Indian mythology and more. As Badami was the capital of Chalukyas for over 2

                    history. In the mail transfer, there are two consecrated places, Ganapati and Durga. There
                    are two Italians made in the latest Chalukya style dating to about the year 1204 AD. Besides
                    these two holy houses, one lies in ruins. It is accepted that there were once 108 Jain
                    Temples and 101 Shiva Temples in the castle grounds. <br><br>Indeed, even today, we can find
                    stones

                    mosques are subject to Mughal and Deccani styles and have minars, vaults and curves. Apart

                    Shah
                    made of red stones later around the old in 1428 by Ahmed Shah Bahmani. Bidar’s fortification

                    or
                    Painted Palace; the Takht Mahal, or royal chamber; Jami Masjid or Great Mosque and Sola Khamba

                    worthy of being of our list best historical sites in Karnataka. Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, the
                    Hindu temple was built during the Hoysala Empire rule. The temple has mentions in medieval Hindu
                    texts, and remains an important pilgrimage site in Vaishnavism.

                    Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas. Though a Vaishnava temple, it includes themes from
                    Shaivism, Shaktism, Jainism and Buddhism. The Chennakeshava temple is a testimony to the
                    artistic, cultural and theological perspectives.

                    facing four different routes, which is why one can see the planned meeting in the city of Bidar. The
                    monument is said to have been built before pre-Islamic times but to follow Islamic engineering in an
                    unusual way.<br><br> It has a rounded base and is operated by a black trap with a large clock
                    mounted, which
                    can be reached by a wandering eighty step. The clock tower serves as a point of view and measures 71
                    meters in length. This tube-shaped structure offers a breathtaking view of the city from the top.

                    Gol Gumbaz is one of the most important heritage sites in Karnataka. History should be the last

                    Muhammad Adil Shah (AD 1626-56), the seventh leader of Adil Shahi. Thus it is considered to be the
                    landmark of Bijapur. Gol Gumbaz is a glorious example of Islamic engineering found in the Deccan
                    region
                    directly. The emblem is loaded with the elements of the brand name of the traditional style of
                    Islamic
                    or Persian architecture and the most visible object is the tail of the focus. The landmark shows its
                    magnificent architecture, seven-fold octagonal plaques, curves on the sides, decorative fences,
                    columns
                    and a curved arrow to conquer the towers.

                    common tourist destination in North Karnataka and gloves once the seat of the Kingdom of
                    Vijayanagara. <br><br>The city is said to have been built between AD 1336 – 1570. A major development is
                    thought to have been completed during the reign of Raja Krishnadeva Raya, the main leader of the
                    movement.<br><br> Today, although Hampi lies in the remains it is still a symbol of rich design and the
                    power of building huge structures. Among the rebuilt buildings in Hampi is the Virupaksha Temple.
                    Spread over 25 sq km there are a lot of cut stone structures where you see what you will be confused
